Abstraction

Object segmentation is a central problem in autonomous driving  scenario. We present a novel approach which is called **DeepLabHD** to reach the sweat point between speed and precision.  With extensive experiment evaluation on the CityScape, KITTI and CamVid dataset, our model can achieve the competitive result as well as traditional well-known object segmentation approaches. We aim to deploy our model into the embedding or chip environment in the practical application.  The implementation of our idea can be founded in [here](https://github.com/SunnerLi/DeepLabHD). Also, you can find our [report](the_report_does_not_release_yet) and re-implement by your own!
